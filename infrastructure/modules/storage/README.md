## Immutable Backup Policy

> **Note:**  
> If you enable the immutable backup policy for this storage account, this is a **one-way operation**. Once set, the immutable policy cannot be removed or reduced in retention period; it can only be extended.  
> Carefully review your requirements before enabling this feature, as it is designed to ensure data cannot be deleted or modified for the specified retention period.
